Even if you’ve been living under a rock, most probably you heard about the Niantic Labs’ game – Pokémon Go. The app took the world by storm and after only two days of being available on the app markets [it already had more users than Tinder](http://fortune.com/2016/07/11/nintendo-pokemon-go/) (another phone app where you can hunt for the nearby “monsters”). If you are already familiar with the game and its situation in China, you can simply scroll down to the guide “How to play Pokémon Go in China”.

The game uses players’ real location, so players have to go outside and wonder around the city to catch them all. App also uses smartphone cameras to give perception of augmented reality and see Pokémons on the background of real world surroundings (which lead to some hilarious pictures). Interesting places such as monuments, museums or landmarks are transformed into PokéStops or Gyms in the virtual world on the smartphones screens.

## Pokemon Go & China

As a total fan of the Pokémon franchise, I also decided to give it a try and bring some of the childhood memories. However, for a Pokémon fan living in China, it’s unsurprisingly complicated to actually enjoy the game, since it relies on Google services, such as Maps. There has been no statement from Chinese officials regarding future plans of possible Pokémon appearances in China. Between [Google’s past in the mainland](http://www.nytimes.com/2010/03/23/technology/23google.html?_r=0) and [Weibo’s conspiracy theories](http://www.reuters.com/article/us-nintendo-pokemon-china-idUSKCN0ZV0YD), some believe the entire game is a US and Japanese conspiracy to map out China’s secret military bases, which leads to a pretty straightforward conclusion: either be patient or find a loophole to play the game. Pokémon Go knock-offs are flourishing on the domestic app market, but they are simply a different game and have nothing to do with the original franchise.

The internet is full of guides on how to spoof your GPS location, but most of these solutions require money spending on location-faking apps or jailbreaking/rooting your phone. And they still leave the problem of going around an absolutely different city than the one you see on your screen. Below you can find a solution of how to play Pokémon Go from the comfort of your home using on-screen joystick to navigate in the virtual world.


## How to play Pokémon Go in China

What you will need:
* iOS device
* Computer
* Internet connection
* VPN
* Cydia Impactor software
* Hacked Pokemon Go IPA

**Warning**: Keep in mind that the following method is a hack and it violates the game rules and potentially might result in account ban for several hours. It is strongly advised to create new Pokemon Go account and use it instead of the main one.
**You will have to repeat the process every 7 days**. (It doesn’t clear your game progress and takes like 5 minutes).

1.	Uninstall Pokemon Go from your phone (if you have it)
2.	Download hacked .ipa file from [here](https://goo.gl/neyP2b), to your computer (v1.3.1)
3.	Download and install the [Cydia Impactor](http://www.cydiaimpactor.com/) (works both on Windows and Mac)
4.	Connect iOS device to the computer and launch Cydia Impactor
5.	Drag and drop the .ipa file into the software and sign in using Apple ID
6.	When prompted, select Allow and it will start signing
7.	Once installed, you need to trust the application on your phone(Settings>General>Profiles & Device Management>Developer APP)
8.	In the game open the hack menu and allow fake location
9. Remember to connect to VPN before opening the game (you just need it to log in with G+ account, it can be disconnected after)

Voilà! Now you have Pokemon Go on steroids and you can catch them all while lying down on your sofa and drinking Tie Guan Yin or other awesome Chinese tea. All you have to do is open the map icon on the hack menu and select location where the game is actually available… hmm, Hong Kong, Japan? It’s up to you.

In case you’ve been *soft banned* – you are not getting any items from PokeStops and Pokémons run away from you, don’t panic. All you have to do is wait an hour or go to nearby PokeStop and spin it for around 40 times. To avoid getting banned to often I recommend saving the fake location in the hack menu and don’t travel crazy distances.

Happy hunting!
