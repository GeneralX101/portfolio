There’s no other app on this planet like WeChat. It allows users to do almost everything from the app’s ecosystem from splitting the restaurant bill to ordering a taxi or even [giving a coffee coupon from Starbucks to your friends](http://adage.com/article/digital/wechat-lets-gift-friends-a-starbucks-coffee/307939/). With more than 700M active users and ‘all in one’ features, WeChat provides not only the convenience for day-to-day users but also an incredibly powerful marketing platform. Through WeChat Official Accounts, individuals and businesses can broadcast messages to its followers. Usually, the this takes the form of articles, which users can comment, like or share, but there are other options, like sending a picture or a video.

WeChat Official Accounts provide a really great channel that brands can leverage to engage and reach their customers. However, Depending on the type of the account, some of the functions and frequency of posting messages vary. So, before starting the registration process, you might want to better understand different features each one first.


## WeChat vs. Wei Xin

 It’s rather important to notice that WeChat platform exists in two versions: International and Chinese. Here’s why: the International account can reach only users registered with “WeChat” application, while the Chinese one has access to both audiences. So if you want to engage with the users in Mainland China, you should definitely go for Wei Xin.

## WeChat Official Accounts
![Different WeChat Official Accounts](/assets/img/posts/{{page.featured-img}}/Different-WeChat-Offical-Accounts.jpg)
There are three different account types:
* **Subscription** (订阅号 – Dìngyuè hào)
* **Service** （服务号 – Fúwù hào）
* **Enterprise** （企业号 – Qǐyè hào）

The Enterprise account is meant to be used for internal communication for companies, rather than for marketing purposes. To be even added to it users have to first follow it and then get confirmed by the account owner. Other functions include creating sub-accounts, which could be used for dividing the communications between company’s different teams or departments.

To engage with WeChat’s regular users, you will need either Subscription or Service account. Subscription accounts can publish content more often: once per day, while Service accounts can only send 4 messages per month. Also, the way users receive messages from those is a bit different. Subscription accounts will appear to the followers within ‘Subscriptions’ folder along with other accounts of those type, whereas services account will be displayed alongside friends users friend chats.

## Individuals and Organizations

There are two options for opening an Official WeChat account, as an individual or organization. Both will require some Chinese documents, so the main difference is that as an individual you are limited to Subscription account, but you won’t need to provide business license during the registration. Also, opening the account should be slightly faster (3 days vs. 7 days).

## Account Verification

If it wasn’t complex enough, on top of everything WeChat accounts can be also verified. Verifying an account will make it rank higher in the search results, have a little “tick” next to the company name, and unlock some extra features. It costs 300RMB per 1 application and lasts for a year.  Getting it might be a good idea to give more credibility to your account. This way, the users will know that they are following the brand’s official WeChat and not a fake one (hey, it’s China, you never know).

## Differences and Features

Now that you know everything about different account types let’s dig into all the different functions between them:

Account Type / Functionality | Unverified Subscription Account | Verified Subscription Account | Unverified Service Account | Verified Service Account
---------------------------- | ------------------------------- | ----------------------------- | -------------------------- | -------------
**Displayed between friend’s messages**	|  |  | √ | √
**Messages displayed in the subscription folder** | √ | √ | | |
**Send 1 message per day** | √ | √ | | |
**Send 4 messages per day** |  |  | √ | √
**Direct communication with follower** | √ | √ | √ | √ |
**Interactive menu on the bottom** | √ | √ | √ | √ |
**Advanced features\*** | | \* |  | √ |
**WeChat Pay and Shop Features** | | \* |  | √ |

Features marked with * are available, but with limited functionality.

## Account Registration

The registration is free and done remotely through the backend platform. But, don’t get too excited, because you’ll need a bunch of documents. And if you’re a foreigner this can be a bit tricky. For personal Chinese Wei Xin Official Account, you will need a photo of a Chinese ‘account manager’ holding their Chinese ID, a scan of that very ID, a scan of Chinese residence ID card, and bank card with the same name linked to WeChat wallet. For the business accounts in addition to the above, you need to provide the scan of Chinese business license and a scan of [filled in authorization letter](https://mp.weixin.qq.com/mpres/zh_CN/htmledition/doc/xxdjb_shou_quan_yun_ying-.doc). Doesn’t matter if its WOFE, Joint Venture or limited liability partnership, As long as the company is registered in mainland China it’s fine. Finally, the bank account owner has to transfer 1RMB to WeChat (Tencent) to finish the registration process.

## Summary

When it comes to choosing the type of account, there are no right or wrong decisions. Everything depends on how you wish to use it. Generally, if you focus your marketing strategy on pushing the content, Subscription account could be the most optimal one. If you wish to integrate more advanced features like linking the interactive menu to external mini-web pages or even adding some of the e-commerce functionality, Service account can be just what you need.
