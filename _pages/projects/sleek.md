Design and development of a gem-based jekyll theme focused on speed performance and minimalistic style. Heavily inspired by... well, my own website.

<div class="btn-center">
  <a class="btn" target="_blank" href="https://github.com/janczizikow/sleek" rel="external">View on Github</a>
  <a class="btn" target="_blank" href="https://janczizikow.github.io/sleek/" rel="external">View Demo Site</a>
