The clinic is a premier high-end physical therapy, sports medicine, and wellness center, based in Shanghai. The objective of the project was to design and develop a responsive newsletter template, that would match the high-end standards of the clinic and remain coherent with its visual identity, while being entirely  editable in Mailchimp interface.
