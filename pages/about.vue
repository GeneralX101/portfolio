            <h1>Hey, nice to meet you! ðŸ‘‹</h1>
            <p>Iâ€™m Jan, 26 year old web developer from Poland. Iâ€™m that guy on the picture enjoying Thai Wake Park and trying to wakeboard for the first time - it was a blast! Anyways, back to serious stuff, during my business studies at collage I got interested in building websites. After graduating I worked for roughly a year as a UX Project Manager in an e-commerce company. As my job involved working with UX designers and developers, my interested in web development increased further - I started learning more and more in my free time after work and at some point I decided to take a changed in my career and pursue my passion - making great web experiences, this time as a developer. Currently Iâ€™m in Berlin, Germany, where I joined a coding bootcamp and Iâ€™m looking for new job opportunities.</p>
